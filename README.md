This repository focuses on the **comparative analysis of deepfake classification performance** using deep learning models on a dataset containing **deepfake and real images of human faces**. The models used include:

- **Vision Transformers (ViT)**
- **Efficient Network**
- **Mobile Network**
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

## üìú Abstract

The problem with deepfakes is that they are synthetic media that have been produced using deep learning techniques hence being used in scams and malicious purposes. In this work, we address and weigh the impact of multiple deep learning models for deepfake classification, including Xception Networks, Vision Transformers (ViTs), Efficient Networks, Mobile Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) Deep Learning Models for Image Detection and Classification among the set of real and fake images after they have been trained on a particular dataset consisting of such relevant pictures for this specific task. All the models were evaluated using the benchmark datasets to measure the accuracy, computational cost, and performance for different types of deepfake manipulation. So, the more optimal and efficient, Xception Network and Vision Transformers were found most accurate in the classification technique along with efficient feature extractors. Nevertheless, the Efficient and Mobile Networks provided better computational performance and resource utilization for real-time applications. Comparing these architectures shows that while improving accuracy may degrade efficiency and vice versa, such a choice of models depends on the specific application. Finally, the understanding of the performance of the employed models in this work can be valuable for enhancing other methods for media authentication and contribute to the efforts to create more protective measures against deepfake technology.
